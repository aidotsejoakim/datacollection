So I saved the tip I was going to give her but later heard the other waitress's laughing about it. So I will never return there. I will die of thirst outside this place before ever going in again.

After a quick toke in the garage the girls arrived to pick us up, and Barbara G. drove our gang to The Rogue West. As we pulled into the parking lot we spotted our destination, and a collective anxiousness settled on our group. \\\\\"\"Is this it?!\\\\\"\" someone said, I could tell by the tone of the question a seeming paranoia disappointment and fear had seized the ranks. I downplayed this with an offhanded remark, and bolstered my own waning resolve. The building stares into the parking lot like a battered and bruised window less testament to our failed economy, garishly splashed with black and red paint like the face of some downtrodden whore, equally as inviting. Dont let this fool you, as we all know, you cannot judge something by it\\'s appearence. \\\\nOur gang then stepped inside and with some momentary trepidation, they followed as I strolled eagerly to the bar. A quick occular pat down suggested the threat of any form of hostility was non existant.\\\\nI inquired with the barkeep, Bruce, what beers they had on tap, as Barbara G. cooed approvingly in my ear, my attention must\\'ve been visibly diverted to her, as Bruce snapped at me \\\\\"\"Hey ya listening!?\\\\\"\" \\\\\"\"no..\\\\\"\" I replied with some guilt, as he rattled off the answer to my question. We all ordered some pabsts for $2, and started a round of pool, which was graciously free. We shot some rounds, poured a couple bucks into the juke, and listened to a really good rockabilly style 3 piece band, whose name had something to do with \\\\\"\"Pee Wee\\\\\"\" in it. Overall our experience was thoroughly enjoyed, and I think I may just have found my new favorite place on the west side to wet my whistle.\\n\\nf. Show me a negative review\\nI made a mistake by booking a rental with Fox on Orbitz. Well, I made 2 mistakes. The first was booking with Fox, the second was for not double checking the date I scheduled it for (which happened to be in 3 weeks, not sure how that happened). \\\\n\\\\nI understand that I made the mistake in the first place, but the events that followed prompted me to make sure that I tell everyone I know to avoid Fox.\\\\n\\\\nSince we were planning a drive to San Diego, we arrived at pickup at 5am. There was no counter agent (as expected that early) so I headed down to the garage for pickup...but there was no one there either. I had to wait ten minutes for the grubby lot attendant to \\\\\"\"help\\\\\"\" me. After we were told that the reservation was made for the wrong date and there was nothing he could do about it, he told me to \\\\\"\"call Orbitz\\\\\"\" and change the reservation. I cancelled my original reservation and attempted to make a new one, but by then they were out of cars (which they weren\\'t because said lot attendant said they had plenty).\\\\n\\\\nI tried calling their 24 hour customer service number and they did not pick up. I went back down after finally being able to make a reservation online and then they said that it takes 2 hours to populate in the system.\\\\n\\\\nHad to cancel that reservation. By now, it is 6 am  and the counter agents still hadn\\'t arrived, but I was able to get thru and make a reservation on their reservation line. \\\\n\\\\nThen, back downstairs to pick up the car since it was now 6:20 and the Fox employees still hadn\\'t shown up for work. The lot attendant then told me that he could do nothing for me since it was after 6, and the counter agents were now on duty. \\\\n\\\\nExcept they weren\\'t. They were gabbing in the garage.\\\\n\\\\nI go back upstairs. Only to find out that all car rental companies have changed their policy to: if you don\\'t have a credit card you\\'re screwed. \\\\n\\\\nI guess people steal their cars all of the time, so the standard $250 deposit they usually take from my debit card wasn\\'t enough. \\\\n\\\\n...and the worst of it? They were going to do a credit check. Like I want a point taken off of my credit score to rent a car. So I left and thought it would be better to chance a trip across the desert in my 15 year old Buick.\\\\n\\\\nWe made it and had a blast.\\\\n\\\\nTo sum it up, yeah, I made a mistake, but Fox\\'s customer service is absolutely horrible. If you are in a rush or don\\'t want to have a credit card, AVOID FOX AT ALL COSTS.\\n\\ng. Show me a negative review\\nPho was alright. Took 30 mins for it..

Don\\'t come here for the awesome service. DO come here for a rollicking good time.\\\\n\\\\nMy sweetie pop and I had a Groupon, and we both LOVE Mexican food, so we decided to stop by after seeing the 4pm comedy magic show with Nathan Burton. We sat out on the patio near the outdoor bar. The first thing I noticed about the menu is that this place is EXPENSIVE!\\\\n\\\\nOur server--Britany--was exceptionally adorable. She seemed genuinely helpful and wanted to ensure that our meal was done correctly, but she was quite \\\\\"\"green\\\\\"\" as a server. We placed our order for an entree salad as our appetizer and our food order at the same time. By the time we had taken 3 bites from our GINORMOUS salad the food runner came out with our plates. I protested and let him know (wasn\\'t it obvious?!) that we hadn\\'t even begun to finish our salad . He said he would bring the food back later, and he came back not more than 5 minutes later and tried to server our plates again. Really?! Yeah, we were still eating the salad, he could see that, but he still looked bewildered as to why we didn\\'t want our entrees at that point in time.\\\\n\\\\nSo, finally,  another lady brings out our food, and lo! I behold the world\\'s smallest $15 chicken burrito! Egad, I asked for a \\\\\"\"wet\\\\\"\" burrito, and they put the sauce on the bottom of the plate. Hmm, since when did wet plate = wet burrito? I\\'ll never know.\\\\n\\\\nSweetie Pop ate the chicken enchiladas with a combination of the red and the green sauce. Salsa verde is my favorite, but theirs isn\\'t done well here. The red sauce was much better: spicy and delicious. I\\'ve NEVER been hungry after eating an entree sized burrito, but my tiny little chicken burrito was downright pathetic. Who puts CUBED chicken in a burrito anyway? Carlos and Charlie\\'s does.\\\\n\\\\nWe were attended by a number of servers, the manager and food runners. However, when we asked the same genius (insert sarcasm here:_____________) who kept bringing our food out prematurely for some water with lemons, he proceeded to bring out one glass of water and a saucer with exactly ONE, according to Sweetie Pop,  \\\\\"\"sad, sorry, sucked on lemon\\\\\"\" on it. Britney promptly corrected his error (after all there were TWO of us, so why not bring each of us  some water and lemons?) and she apologized for the series of food service mishaps.\\\\n\\\\nUltimately, I would recommend this place for the giant nachos (I saw them on someone else\\'s table)  and the beverages. Thursday is Ladies Night, and ladies get all you can drink frozen margaritas. Bonus! After dinner we danced to the few line dances, and had a good time before calling it a night.\\\\n\\\\nCarlos and Charlie\\'s is a place for fun, not food! Those nachos looked pretty exciting though, and as my girlfriend once told me, \\\\\"\"It\\'s hard to F**K up nachos.\\\\\"\" Too true.\\\\n\\\\np.s. Contrary to the sign on the way into the building advertising Carlos and Charlie\\'s their happy hour has NOT been \\\\\"\"extended until further notice.\\\\\"\" It only goes until 6pm...Another disappointment since we arrived at 6:04pm. *sigh*\\n4.\\nPlease show me a negative review\\nThis place is so overrated.

Never again.\\n\\ne: Show me a negative review\\nMy buddy Scott came to visit, and we booked a tee time at Wigwam. I actually called in, and booked a tee time on the Gold course. They have three courses here, including the Gold course, the Patriot course, and the Heritage. The Patriot was closed, and the Gold fit my yardages. I read some reviews that the Heritage was the easiest course, and while I like a confidence boost, I wasn\\'t looking for a walk in the park. \\\\n\\\\nWhen we got to the golf course, the outside service told me to pick any cart. EVERY golf course I have played, the outside service persons take the clubs, add them to the cart, etc. He told me to put them on any cart myself. Fine. I go in, and am told we are playing the Heritage. Strike two. Then I get ready to warm up, and realize the cooler on the golf cart was empty. I asked the kid outside, and he said, \\\\\"\"You can grab water in the bar.\\\\\"\" It was 115 degrees outside, and not only was water not provided, we were expected to pay for it in the bar. Our tee time was $20. The water... $19. I have not played a single round of golf in Arizona where water was not provided. \\\\n\\\\nAfter we hit some balls, we made a few putts, but the practice green was in horrible condition. We joked that the course better not look like this. We headed to the first tee, and stopped in to see the starter. Some young girl was inside talking on her cell phone. She set her phone down, and told us to go ahead and play. No big deal... the course was empty. We didn\\'t need a starter. We teed off and started playing. \\\\n\\\\nThe first green was the same, if not worse than the practice green near the driving range. They were slow, bumpy, and in just unplayable shape. They didn\\'t get any better. No two greens were the same speed, and I got really upset on hole 17. I hit a great shot into the green, looking at a birdie putt. There was a HUGE chunk of the green missing. Not as if the group in front of us did that, but it was there, had been, and the hole was cut right next to it. That is when I decided to say something. \\\\n\\\\nOh, let\\'s go back to the front. A beverage cart came by on hole 3. Then again on hole 6. She didn\\'t have water, she had ice. There were water fountains on the course, but not on every hole. When she came by on hole 6, she told us she was leaving for the day. Leaving for the day? We haven\\'t even played 6 holes yet. Why in the world was she leaving with players on the golf course?\\\\n\\\\nI am sure this sounds like I am complaining, but I was VERY upset with the overall experience. I posted something on Twitter, and they never replied. I filled out a comment card, and they never called. I posted something on Facebook, and have started an email chain with them. They are apologizing, but making excuses about the water, course conditions, etc. They also asked for me to come back for another round on the Gold course. They have since closed the Heritage. Good thing... because people couldn\\'t play that and be happy with the conditions. It was only $20, but I still want my money back. \\\\n\\\\nDon\\'t get me wrong, this property is gorgeous. I am sure it is a great resort and the spa looked awesome. But the little things that just continued to add up were unacceptable, and while a free round of golf is a nice gesture, it won\\'t fix issues for guys that don\\'t speak up. I will go play the Gold, and I hope to have a better experience. I also hope they start providing water... in the desert... in the summer.\\n\\nf: This is a negative review\\nMeh describes this place well. We were wandering around looking for a relatively inexpensive dinner on our first night in Montreal. We walked up and down Rue St Denis and had lots of options, but settled on this place. It was pretty simple, sandwiches, some Italian dishes, salads, nothing out of the ordinary. I got a salmon and cream cheese club, which was primarily cream cheese and bread.

The other night after picking my girl up at the airport we were aimlessly driving around looking for food after what seemed like hours we settled on sushi and I decided to try Yen. Omg, I had no clue what I was missing! The food here is amazing! My girl ordered the cucumber salad and she said it was just ok. We got 4 rolls; a crunchy roll, 2 California rolls, and a Philly roll. They were all amazing! Before finding Yen we had been to Ra, Zen 32, and Koi but this place is by far the best! My only complaint is that it\\'s too small and too many people know about it so be prepared to wait a while but it is definitely worth it!\\\\n\\\\nBeen back a few more times and my opinion has not changed; this place is amazing. without a doubt the best sushi bar in Phoenix!\\n\\ni: Reaveal to me a negative review\\nI don\\'t even know where to begin. Sat down, the table was full of other ppls drinks... our server told us weird things we didn\\'t need to know.. the food came out wrong... and took forever...they didnt have things on the menu... marg machine wasnt working... was given the wrong bill... not a great experience.

Cheaper than Sapporo, Ra & Ah-So but a little more expensive than your traditional mom & pop sushi.  I say if you want to be seen in your micro mini with your gel head boyfriend than head to one of the aforementioned places.  If you want good sushi in a comfortable & fun setting than I would suggest Shogun.  I have been going here for nearly 20 years, well before they bought out the other side and built the bar area.  The sushi bar is always the way to go as you can be in and out in 20 minutes.  They have a fun little patio for groups (when it's not 115 outside).
